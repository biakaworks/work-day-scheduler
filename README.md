<h1 align="center">Work Day Scheduler</h1>

## Description
📖 The Work Day Scheduler allows you to break your work day from 9am - 5pm into rows of hours.  In these rows, you can write your plan for the day, and save it by pressing the "Save" icon.  If you do not click on Save, your written agenda will be lost.  But if you saved it, it will store the information on your local browser via localStorage.

Have fun with Work Day Scheduler
